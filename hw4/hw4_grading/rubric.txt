Record lookups without querying a recursive nameserver
===

For each of these tests, I issued the given query against your server.  If
your server responded with the expected answer in less than 5 seconds,
I then also checked the requests your server sent over the network and checked
that they were similar to what was expected (I very loosely checked this
by seeing if your server issued the # of queries I expected.  I didn't
actually check the content of those queries).


Question 1
---
I queried "grc.com" against your server.  I then made sure that you returned
the expected answer, "4.79.142.200 and made at least 3 queries.  Example
correct traffic should give something like the below
	dig @198.41.0.4 grc.com
	dig @m.gtld-servers.net grc.com
	dig @ns4.customer.level3.net grc.com
	grc.com.        28800   IN  A   4.79.142.200

Question 2
---
I queried "www.internic.net", checked that it gave "192.0.32.9" in at least
7 queries, eg:
	dig @198.41.0.4 www.internic.net
	dig @m.gtld-servers.net www.internic.net
	dig @ns1.crsnic.net www.internic.net
	Gives CNAME internicwww.vip.icann.org

	dig @198.41.0.4 internicwww.vip.icann.org
	dig @d0.org.afilias-nst.org. internicwww.vip.icann.org
	dig @b.iana-servers.net. internicwww.vip.icann.org
	dig @gtm1.lax.icann.org internicwww.vip.icann.org
	internicwww.vip.icann.org. 30   IN      A       192.0.32.9

Question 3
---
Queried "www.yahoo.com.tw" and checked that "74.6.50.150" was returned in
at least 10 queries.
	dig @198.41.0.4 www.yahoo.com.tw
	dig @i.dns.tw www.yahoo.com.tw
	dig @ns5.yahoo.com www.yahoo.com.tw
	Gives CNAME rc.yahoo.com

	dig @198.41.0.4 rc.yahoo.com
	dig @m.gtld-servers.net rc.yahoo.com
	dig @ns1.yahoo.com rc.yahoo.com	
	Gives CNAME src.g03.yahoodns.net

	dig @198.41.0.4 src.g03.yahoodns.net
	dig @m.gtld-servers.net src.g03.yahoodns.net
	dig @ns1.yahoo.com src.g03.yahoodns.net
	dig @yf3.a1.b.yahoo.net src.g03.yahoodns.net
	src.g03.yahoodns.net.   300     IN      A       74.6.50.150

Question 4
---
Queried "ds.v6ns.test-ipv6.com" gets to "216.218.228.119" in at least 4 queries
	dig @2001:503:BA3E::2:30 ds.v6ns.test-ipv6.com
	dig @a.gtld-servers.net ds.v6ns.test-ipv6.com
	dig @ns1.test-ipv6.com ds.v6ns.test-ipv6.com
	dig @v6ns1.test-ipv6.com ds.v6ns.test-ipv6.com
	ds.v6ns.test-ipv6.com.  360     IN      A       216.218.228.119


Caching Tests
===

Question 5
---
I first queried "grc.com" and checked that you gave the correct response,
ignoring whatever information was sent over the wire by your server.  Then,
I ran the query again and checked that your server gave the correct result
again, but did not generate any additional network traffic.

Question 6
---
I first queried "cs.uic.edu" and checked that your server gave the right
response.  Then, I queried "econ.uic.edu" and checked that your server
only sent one additional query over the network (again I didn't go so far
as to actually check the bodies of the queries, only the #).

	dig @198.41.0.4 cs.uic.edu
	dig @l.edu-servers.net cs.uic.edu
	dig @uic-dns2.uic.edu cs.uic.edu
	cs.uic.edu.             47950   IN      A       131.193.32.29

    Then	

	dig @uic-dns2.uic.edu econ.uic.edu
	econ.uic.edu.		86400	IN	A	131.193.206.16

Serving Multiple Requests
===

Question 7
---
I started your server, and then queried "grc.com" 10 times in parallel.  I
then checked the combined output of each request and checked to make sure that
it contained the correct answer 10 times.  Your server was given 5 seconds
to respond to all queries.


Error Handling
===

Question 8
---
On my test machine I blocked all outgoing UDP traffic to port 53.  I then
queried the student server once and waited a second.  Then I removed the block
and reissued the query for "cs.uic.edu" and checked that I was given the right
answer.

Question 9
---
I replaced the given list of good root servers with a new list of 2 addresses,
the first being a server that doesn't have a DNS server running on it,
and the second being a true DNS root server.  I then queried the student's
server with "fsf.org" and checked that I got "208.118.235.131" back in
6 seconds or less.

Question 10
---
I replaced the list of root servers students were given with another new
list of two addresses (both of which did not speak DNS).  I then queried
the student's server for "noscript.net" and checked that I got "SERVFAIL"
back in the student's reply within 10 seconds.
